# Lightgun Keyboard

  A fork of Arduino keyboard Library.
  
# What makes this fork different?
      
      - Added WASD 
  
      - Added Numbers (Not numberpad real numbers)
      
      - Rearrange things 
      
      - Removed unnecessary buttons from Keyboard.h

      - I basiclly just found buttons I wanted to add & tweak code to be more Lightgun friendly.
